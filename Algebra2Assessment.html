4. Kepler’s third law of planetary motion states that the square of the time required for a planet to make one revolution about the sun varies directly as the cube of the average distance of the planet from the sun. If you assume that Mars is 1.5 times as far from the sun as is the earth, find the approximate length of a Martian year, in Earth years.

7. You are designing a marble basin that will house a fountain for the city park. The basin's sides and bottom should be one foot thick. Its outer length should be twice the outer width and outer height. What should the outer dimensions be if you want the basin to hold 36 cubic feet of water? You may draw a diagram to help you solve this problem.
